- **Big data is larger, more complex datasets from data sources. These datasets can also be unstructured datasets that cannot be stored in relational databases. At the same time, these large and complex data sets cannot be processed with traditional methods.

- **Big data components;**

    <ul>
        <li>Velocity</li>
        <li>Volume</li>
        <li>Variety</li>

    </ul>
    


- **Apache Spark tool, which provides high performance, is used to solve big data problems and to process large, complex data sets efficiently. Since Spark performs data processing over RAM, it provides great savings in terms of time and performance.**
